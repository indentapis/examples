# Indent Software Development Kit Examples

Indent enables simple, fast access requests & reviews for your cloud apps and infrastructure.

With [Webhooks](./webhooks), you can safely connect Indent to your cloud while keeping API tokens and credentials opaque to Indent.

Using a [Webhook](./webhooks), you can...

- [Grant and revoke access via Okta](./webhooks/terraform-aws-okta-webhook)
- [Create tickets or grant/revoke roles in Jira](./webhooks/terraform-aws-jira-webhook)
- [Add and remove users from a channel in Slack](./webhooks/serverless-aws-slack-webhook)
- [Create tickets via emails to your service desk](./webhooks/serverless-aws-ses-webhook)

... or create your own by following the [Custom Webhook Guide](https://indent.com/docs/connect/custom-webhook).
