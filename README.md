# Indent Software Development Kit Examples

Indent enables simple, fast access requests & reviews for your cloud apps and infrastructure.

With [Webhooks](./webhooks), you can safely connect Indent to your cloud resources while keeping API tokens and credentials on your infrastructure.

Using a [Webhook](./webhooks), you can...

- [Grant and revoke access via Okta](./webhooks/change/terraform-aws-okta-webhook)
- [Create tickets or grant/revoke roles in Jira](./webhooks/change/terraform-aws-jira-webhook)
- [Pull users and groups from Okta](./webhooks/pull/terraform-aws-okta-pull-webhook)
- [Create tickets via emails to your service desk](./webhooks/xyz/serverless-aws-ses-webhook)

... or create your own by following the [Webhooks Guide](https://indent.com/docs/webhooks).
